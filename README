Remember before running mvn to include /usr/local/lib (for tokyo cabinet)
in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Unix) / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (Mac).

To build the project run:
  mvn clean install

To build the classpath:
  mvn dependency:build-classpath

To run apps:
  export CLASSPATH=`cat .maven_classpath`:target/tokyoutil-1.0.jar
  java -server com.orbious.util.tokyo.app.Dumper -h

  To kill the apps send a SIGTERM to the process.
  
To deploy:
  mvn -DaltDeploymentRepository=snapshot-repo::default::file:./snapshots/ clean deploy
  mvn -DaltDeploymentRepository=releases::default::file:./releases/ clean deploy
